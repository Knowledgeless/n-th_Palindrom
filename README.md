# nth_Palindrom

<p>Hello Allien,<br>
I thought everyone of us uses code to find a number is palindrom or not. But what if I write a code to find the nth palindrom number using python3! I know there is a lot of code to do that. But, I tried to do that by myself. And boom..! I have done. <br> You may use this code on your phone through <b><i>termux</i></b> or any other IDE. I have tried to <i>comment</i> in every line so that you can understand. <br><br>
<h3>Happy Coding</h3>
